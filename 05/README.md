a force layout where like-nodes cluster together, drawn from static data

now with links! the graph shown is `firm.csv` from [@elijah_meeks](https://twitter.com/elijah_meeks)'s block [Networks - Graphs 5](https://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/39fea1d900964379416b), converted to `json` 

this iteration also adds data-driven clusters ðŸŽ‰ 

clusters are detected with [jLouvain](https://github.com/upphiminn/jLouvain), a Javascript implementation of the [Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure#The_Louvain_method) community detection algorithm
